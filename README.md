## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following tools installed:

*   [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (v1.0 or higher)
*   [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd apex_options_trader
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    The application frontend and the local worker backend will be started concurrently.
    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The project is organized into three main directories:

*   `src/`: Contains the frontend React application code, including pages, components, hooks, and utility functions.
*   `worker/`: Contains the backend Hono application running on a Cloudflare Worker, including API routes and entity definitions for the Durable Object.
*   `shared/`: Contains TypeScript types and mock data shared between the frontend and the backend to ensure type safety.

## üíª Development

*   **Frontend:** All React components are located in `src/components`, pages in `src/pages`, and global state management with Zustand can be configured as needed.
*   **Backend:** API endpoints are defined in `worker/user-routes.ts` using the Hono framework. Business logic is encapsulated in entities within `worker/entities.ts`, which interact with the global Durable Object for persistence.
*   **Styling:** The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. UI components are built using `shadcn/ui`. Customize the theme and styles in `tailwind.config.js` and `src/index.css`.
